## Description

Jubo in Korean stands for handout or bulletin. I made this digital church bulletin for a local church that wanted to save time, paper, and money. 

Created to be minimal so that it does not distract church attenders and simple so that anyone from any age can use it. 

Designed to be easily updated weekly by copying prior bulletins.

The client side of this app is built using REACT. The backend is built using NODE and POSTGRESS which allows for CRUD operations.

To see the application in use look at: [https://jubo.vercel.app/jubo/gilbear](https://jubo.vercel.app/jubo/gilbear)

Designed for mobile, users will scan a QR code before entering the church. Users will be noted to open a web app where they can see the worship order, add events to their calendars, save addresses to their google maps, and take note of the church's contact info.
